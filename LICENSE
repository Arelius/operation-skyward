THE DON'T BE A DICK LICENSE

Redistribution and modification are not specificially permitted.

I'm not yet ready to put a blanket license permitting redistribution of this particular code, specificially due to the fact that I don't see anyone seeing any desire for it yet. However, if this turns out to not be true, do send me a message, I'm overall very open to very liberal licensing.

With that said, in general, unless you have malicious intent and/or are "being a dick", I don't imagine being upset if I found my code in use, but really, send me a message, It may compel me to put a blanket BSD-style license over the codebase, or the specific bit of code of interest.
